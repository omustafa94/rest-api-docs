## Readme
This repo contains the entirety of documentation pages that are used to build Earthport's REST API documentation at [https://docs.earthport.com](https://docs.earthport.com).

The online documentation includes a section called 'Guides' which contains a number of pages that are generated from the markdown files within this repo.

Currently these pages are manually added to [APIMATIC](https://apimatic.io) to create the documentation. However, APIMatic has its own REST APIs so in future we will be able to generate the documentation automatically from a CI/CD pipeline by checking out these changes and calling the relevant APIs.
